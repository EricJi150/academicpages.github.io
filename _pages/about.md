📚 I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in computer engineering. I am currently a part of the [Vision Group @ UIUC](https://vision.cs.illinois.edu/vision_website/) under the supervision of [Dr. Svetlana Lazebnik](https://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/).

🖥️ My research interests are in producing meaningful applications of computer vision and robotics.

🎣 My personal hobbies include fishing, olympic weightlifting, and gaming.

**I will be graduating this May and am currently applying to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2024.**
