📚 I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

🖥️ My research interests are in producing meaningful applications of computer vision and artificial intelligence.

🎣 My personal hobbies include fishing, golf, weightlifting, and gaming.

**I am currently looking for CV/AI internships for summer 2025.**
