Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence are bringing great concerns for privacy, security and misinformation. Our work focuses on the detection of fake images generated by text-to-image models. We propose a dualdomain CNN-based classifier that utilizes image features in both the spatial and frequency domain. Through an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that the frequency domain features facilitate high accuracy, zero-transfer learning between different generative models, and faster convergence. To our best knowledge, this is the first effective detector against generative models that are finetuned for a specific subject.
